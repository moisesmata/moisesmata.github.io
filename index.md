## Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, control theory, and optimization. I'm particularly interested in developing efficient algorithms for resource-constrained embedded systems.

### Current Research

**TinyMPC - A²R Lab, Columbia University** (Jan 2025 - Present)
- Working on TinyMPC, an open-source convex model-predictive control solver
- Focused on resource-constrained platforms under Professor Brian Plancher
- Developing embedded systems solutions for robotics applications

### Past Research

**SURF@JPL Research Fellow, NASA JPL** (Apr 2024 - Aug 2024)
- Conducted research under Dr. Yasuhiro Hasegawa at JPL
- Trained machine learning classifiers to analyze Kepler Space Telescope data
- Developed models to infer the existence of habitable exoplanets
