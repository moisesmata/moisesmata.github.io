## Research

I'm interested in robotics and control, specifically algorithms that help robotic systems operate in uncertain environments with minimal human input. My primary focus is on planetary exploration, but I'm also drawn to terrestrial applications like wildfire detection and search and rescue. With experience in flight software, I aim toward implementation-driven solutions that work on real hardware.
